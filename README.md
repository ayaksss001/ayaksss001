Hello! My name is Kirill.

I am a developer with an interest in system programming, low-level code, engineering, and physics. I write in C/C++, work with OpenGL, sockets, Arduino, and enjoy diving into hardware and system logic down to the last detail.

What I know:
	•	CLI tool development in C
	•	Working with TCP servers and sockets
	•	Creating visualizations with OpenGL
	•	Simple projects on Arduino
	•	Studying electronics, microcontrollers, and prototype assembly
	•	I love clean, understandable, and logical code

Currently working on:
	•	2D/3D physics visualization of spacetime
	•	Tools in C (cat, hex-dump, loggers)
	•	Engineering experiments with Arduino and ESP32

Goals:
	•	Get my first job in game development / systems programming
	•	Grow as an engineer-programmer
	•	Build projects that work like clockwork

Languages:
	•	Russian (Native)
	•	Romanian (Learning)
	•	English (A2-B1)
